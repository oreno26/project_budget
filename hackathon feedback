Project Budget app.
What I like about this project firstly is that its a practical tool you can really use!
Useful projects are the best because they think of a problem and tackle it. Great job with the idea.
The execution on the other hand is.... well also fantastic!!
The querying to the database is done well and you have a good file structure with your routes, moduels and controllers.
Im happy to hear you found it challenging , that means you have learnt a lot.
Keep at it very proud of your progress!
